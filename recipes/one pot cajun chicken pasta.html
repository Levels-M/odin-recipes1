        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>You can have this creamy and comforting pasta with chicken on the table in just 30 minutes and best of all, it all cooks in one pot â€” you won't even need to boil water first! It's packed with tender chicken thighs, bell peppers, and onions, and finished off with a creamy tomato sauce.</p>
        <h3>Ingridients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>1 pound boneless, skinless chicken thighs (about 4), cut into 1-inch pieces</li>
            <li>2 1/2 teaspoons Cajun seasoning</li>
            <li>2 medium green bell peppers, stemmed, seeded and cut into 1/4-inch strips</li>
            <li>1 small yellow onion, thinly sliced</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, chopped</li>
            <li>12 ounces smooth penne (see Cook's Note)</li>
            <li>4 cups low-sodium chicken broth</li>
            <li>One 14.5-ounce can diced tomatoes</li>
            <li>6 ounces cream cheese, cubed, at room temperature</li>
            <li>Kosher salt</li>
            <li>4 scallions, sliced, for serving</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><p>Heat the oil in large wide pot over medium-high heat. Add the chicken and Cajun seasoning and cook, stirring occasionally, until the chicken just starts to change color and the spices are toasted, about 2 minutes.</p></li>
            <li><p>Add the peppers and onions and cook until they just begin to release some of their juices, 3 to 4 minutes. Stir in the garlic and cook until softened, 1 minute.</p></li>
            <li><p>Add the pasta, chicken broth and tomatoes and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. When it boils, continue to cook, stirring occasionally, until the pasta is al dente and the sauce is thickened and reduced by about half, about 15 minutes.</p></li>
            <li><p>Remove from the heat and add the cream cheese and 1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt. Stir until the cream cheese is combined and melted. Don't worry if the sauce looks runny, it will thicken as it sits. Top with sliced scallions.</p></li>
        </ol>
